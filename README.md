# Basic File Hosting with Flask

This project is simply to demonstrate how we can use Python Flask to show a folder wirelessly, and allow others to download files from said folder.

Please note that this system is VERY basic. Extra experience is required to add security, other features and to deploy this app (if you really want to).
