# Basic File Hosting with Flask

This project is simply to demonstrate how we can use Python Flask to show a folder wirelessly, and allow others to download files from said folder.

Please note that this system is VERY basic. Extra experience is required to add security, other features and to deploy this app (if you really want to).

## SETUP

Firstly, you need to have your python environment set up however you like it. If you don't know how to do this, search up a tutorial or something. I, personally, use the Builtin Python Package Manager: pip.

You need to install both Flask and AutoIndex for Flask.

Open the integrated Python Console on Pycharm, or just use CMD for windows (which is not on linux, and I don't know how to do that myself, so search up another tutorial.) Or any other method of installing modules you have. I use Pycharm and Pip, so here's what I'd type:

`pip install Flask Flask-AutoIndex`

Then, download the repo. Or just copy the code. Just do something that makes the code and the designated folder sit in the same, neat folder. Preferablly your projects folder. Make sure that your file structure is the same as mine. Note that the `.bat` file is optional, because I don't want to open my IDE or my console every time I want to run this file.

## Tweaking

Inside the `main.py` file, you can change the paths of the explored folder to practically anything. Even the root of your hard-drive. Which is a horrible idea and I don't recommend doing that, unless this hard drive is a designated hard drive to be explored by your network, then go wild. From there, you can add literally any feature you want. Look at documentation, watch tutorials, use knowledge you probably already have. Go make something cool, and new, and something useful to YOU!

## Sidenote

Most of what I said is only really applicable to me, a WINDOWS user, using PIP and PYCHARM. If this doesn't apply to you, then you have the entire internet to explore and find an answer. This is the age of information we are in, after all.

Another point to mention, I am still learning. We all are. Any tips would be appreciated, and forking this project to show off features you've developed would help not only me, but everyone in the same boat as you and I.
